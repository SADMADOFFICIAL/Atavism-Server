    including without limitation, any implied warranties of merchantability,
    fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Further, Dragonsan

    warranty constitutes an essential part of this agreement. All the 
    foregoing disclaimers also apply in full with respect to 
    Dragonsan Studios licensors, suppliers, distributors, contractors, 
    and agents. Because some states do not allow the exclusion of implied 
    warranties, the foregoing limitations of liability shall apply only to
    the full extent permitted by law.
    
6.	Limitation of Remedies and Damages. Under no circumstances and under 
    no legal theory, including, but not limited to, tort, contract, negligence,

    or any other person (i) for any indirect, special, incidental, or 
    consequential damages of any character or (ii) for any matter beyond its 
    reasonable control. Dragonsan Studios liability for damages of any kind 
    whatsoever arising out of this agreement is limited to the lesser of the 
    total fees paid by you to Dragonsan Studios (if any) or $10 (U.S.), 
    except where not permitted by applicable law, in which case 
    Dragonsan Studios liability shall be limited to the minimum amount 
    permitted by such applicable law. All the foregoing limitations shall 
    apply even if Dragonsan Studios has been informed of the possibility 
    of such damages. All the foregoing limitations also apply with respect 
    to Dragonsan Studios suppliers, licensors, distributors, contractors, 
    and agents. Because Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation 
    of incidental or consequential damages, the foregoing limitations of 
    liability shall apply only to the full extent permitted by law.

    contractors, and agents shall have no liability whatsoever for any use

    Dragonsan Studios and its licensors, suppliers, distributors, contractors, 
    and agents from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and fees (including
    reasonable attorney fees) arising from your use of the Software as well 
    as from your failure to comply with any term of this Agreement. To the 
    maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby release, and waive 
    all claims against, Dragonsan Studios and its licensors, suppliers, 
    employees, and agents from any, and all liability for claims, damages 
    (actual and consequential), costs, and expenses (including litigation

    except as provided in this Agreement. Upon termination, the Agreement 
    granted hereunder shall terminate and you shall immediately discontinue

    with all export laws and restrictions and regulations of the Department of 
    Commerce, the United States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets
    Control ("OFAC"), or other the United States or foreign agency or authority,
    and you agree not to export or allow the export or re-export of the Software
    in violation of any such restrictions, laws or regulations. By using the 
    Software, you agree to the foregoing and represent and warrant that you are

    restricted country. 
    
10.	Governing Law and Jurisdiction. You agree that this Agreement will be deemed 
    to have been made and executed in Poland, and any dispute will be resolved 
    in accordance with the laws of Poland excluding that body of law related 
    to choice of laws. Any action or proceeding brought to enforce the terms 
    of this Agreement or to adjudicate any dispute must be brought in the Court 
    in Poland. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of this court. 
    You waive any claim of inconvenient forum and any right to a jury trial. 
    The Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not 
    apply. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract 
    shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this Agreement.
    
11.	Class Action Waiver. You agree not to bring or participate in a class or 
    representative action, private attorney general action, or collective 
    arbitration related to the Licensed Technology or this Agreement. You also

    Software or this Agreement with any other action or arbitration without the 
    consent of all parties to this Agreement and all other actions or arbitrations.
    
12.	Miscellaneous. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created
    as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of any kind 
    to bind Dragonsan Studios in any respect whatsoever. The failure of either 
    party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be 
    deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of this 
    Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be 
    limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement 
    shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This 
    Agreement is not assignable, transferable, or sublicensable by you except 
    with Dragonsan Studios prior written consent. Dragonsan Studios may transfer, 
    assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights and obligations without 
    consent. Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive 
    statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels 
    all previous written and oral agreements, communications, and other understandings 
    relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and, except as otherwise 
    provided herein, that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties.
