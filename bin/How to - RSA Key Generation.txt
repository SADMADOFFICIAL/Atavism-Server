1) Using Cygwin or a Linux shell, make your way to the atavism_server/bin directory

2) Generate the key by typing: 
openssl genrsa -des3 -out atavism.pem 2048

It will ask for a password - set it to whatever you like

3) Export the Public Key by typing: 
openssl rsa -in atavism.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out atavismkey.txt

4) Copy the Public Key to your Unity project and place it in the Resources folder in your project

5) Export the Decrypted Private Key by typing: 
openssl rsa -in atavism.pem -out private.pem -outform PEM

6) Convert the private key to a format usable in the server by typing:
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform DER -in private.pem  -nocrypt > private.key
